robotformations package

The robot formation package has 5 different nodes. All this nodes use the follower.h, math_rf.h and repulsive.h file.
The rf_node_column_sim and rf_node_oblique_sim are the nodes to be used in simulation without considering camera constraints.
The rf_node_column_simCamera and rf_node_column_simCamera are the nodes to be used in simulation considering camera constraints.
The rf_node_switch_column2oblique_simCamera is the node to switch from column to oblique shape in simulation.
